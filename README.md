# What's your favorite _______?
In this assignment, I made a small webpage that prompts the user for their some of their favorite things. 
I'm not sure if I needed a README for this assignment, but I'll use it to put the requirements in:

- Create a form with a minimum of 4 pieces of criteria to validate (ex. Name/Price/Description/Expiration Date)
- If there is any invalid data error messages should be shown
- Invalid input should display errors on the page, not in alert boxes
- Error messages should be descriptive
- Validation must be done in JavaScript or TypeScript NOT HTML ATTRIBUTES
- Project must be stored on GitHub and commits must be used. Minimum 7 commits
- Create a class and use an object of that type. Displaying data using an object is a simple way to achieve this and will be covered in lecture.
